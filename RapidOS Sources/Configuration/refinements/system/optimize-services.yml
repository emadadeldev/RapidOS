  # ================================================================================================ #
  # These services unnecessary for typical operation or are rarely used in most environments.        #
  # By disabling them or setting them to Manual startup, system resources are conserved, potentially #
  # improving performance.                                                                           #
  #                                                                                                  #
  # These changes are safe for most users, as these services are either related to legacy            #
  # features, specific hardware or software configurations, or are otherwise redundant in            #
  # the current system setup. They can be re-enabled if specific functionality is required.          #

  # Disabling these services is unnecessary because their default setting ensures they only activate #
  # when required by the system or specific applications. This approach maintains system stability   #
  # and ensures that resources are only used when needed.                                            #
