  # SysMain, which was previously known as Superfetch, is a Windows service designed to speed up your system by caching frequently used data.  #
  # Essentially, it helps your apps load faster by remembering the data they need and storing it in a special folder (C:\Windows\Prefetch).    #
  # It also tries to save space by combining similar data in memory.                                                                           #
  #                                                                                                                                            #
  # In the past, SysMain would make the cache folder grow quite large, but now it's capped at ~100 files.                                      #
  # Turning off SysMain won't really hurt your system, but if you keep it on, it could improve performance by caching common usage patterns.   #
  # Just be aware that it might use more RAM, especially if you're running memory-heavy programs or have an SSD.                               #
  # There's some debate about how much of a difference it actually makes.                                                                      #
  #                                                                                                                                            #
  # I started thinking about SysMain because of an issue discussed on the AtlasOS github page.                                                 #
  # Thanks to them for bringing it up - you can check out the details here: https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues/1093.                     #
  #                                                                                                                                            #
  # Note: RapidOS sets the SysMain service priority to "Below Normal" to reduce it's resource usage.                                           #
