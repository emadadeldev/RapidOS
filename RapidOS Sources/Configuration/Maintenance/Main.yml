  # Verifies and prepares the Windows environment. Fixes common     #
  # issues from non-clean installs: broken system components,       #
  # Windows 10 â†’ 11 upgrade leftovers, and problems caused by       #
  # previous tweaks.                                                #
  # Also prepares the system if RapidOS is being installed on a     #
  # used or previously tweaked Windows installation.                #
