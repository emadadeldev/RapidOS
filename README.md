*RapidOS is an open-source project that aims to revolutionize the Windows experience - a powerful, streamlined, user-centric system that puts you in control.* ‚ö°

## ‚ùì Why RapidOS?

RapidOS modifies Windows to make your system faster, cleaner, and more secure. It's not standalone software - just a set of tweaks applied for real, everyday improvements. Here's why you should consider it:

#### üîí Privacy first
RapidOS locks down your privacy. It blocks Windows telemetry that tracks you and strengthens security to keep unwanted access out.

#### üèéÔ∏è Better performance
It's all about speed. RapidOS cuts out bloatware that slows your system and adjusts settings for better performance. No gaming miracles, just faster daily use.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Clean and simple
The interface gets streamlined. No clutter or unnecessary features - RapidOS keeps it simple and easy to use for anyone who likes things clean.

#### üí° Join the community
RapidOS is a project you can jump into. Hit up [Rapid Community](https://discord.rapid-community.ru) to share ideas, provide feedback to help improve the system, or chat with others who want a better Windows.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Support when you need it
If something goes wrong, community's got you. Developers and active users offer quick tips or help with bigger issues.

*RapidOS turns Windows into something better: private, fast, and simple, backed by a solid crew.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Want to deploy?

If you're looking to deploy, make sure to read the [official documentation by Ameliorated](https://docs.amelabs.net/) to fully understand how the playbooks work.

In short, while the playbooks are in `.apbx` format, they are actually `7z` archives protected with the password `malte`.
Our playbooks consist of `.yml` (default AME Beta configuration files), `.ps1` and `.bat` files.

In most `.yml` files, you can adjust many of RapidOS's changes. For example, you can configure AppX file to prevent the deletion of necessary apps you need. In `custom.yml`, you can also disable specific `.yml` files by commenting them out with `#`.

You'll need a text editor to deploy the project:
