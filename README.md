## üõ†Ô∏è Want to Deploy?

If you're looking to deploy, make sure to read the [official documentation by Ameliorated](https://docs.ameliorated.io/) to fully understand how the playbooks work.

In short, while the playbooks are in `.apbx` format, they are actually `7z` archives protected with the password `malte`.
Our playbooks consist of `.yml` (default AME Wizard configuration files), `.ps1` and `.bat` files.

In most `.yml` files, you can adjust many of RapidOS's changes. For example, you can configure AppX file to prevent the deletion of necessary apps you need. In `custom.yml`, you can also disable specific `.yml` files by commenting them out with `#`.

You'll need a text editor to deploy the project:
